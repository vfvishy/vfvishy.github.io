\section*{Microbubble Condensation: Single-Bubble Dynamics}

Condensation around a cold microbubble is dominated by latent heat removal.

\subsection*{Governing Physics}

The Stefan number is defined as
\[
Ste = \frac{C_p (T_\infty - T_i)}{L}
\]

For $Ste \ll 1$, condensation dominates.

\subsection*{Implications}

This supports the feasibility of surface-less microbubble condensers.
